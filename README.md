# CSE 1142 - JavaFX Project: Cringe Pane - Submitted To: Dr. Sanem Arslan YÄ±lmaz

To run this JavaFX program, you need Java 11 and JavaFX to be installed on your comuter. We used OpenJDK and OpenJFX while working on the project.

After installing, you need to add the following JVM arguments to run the project:

```
--module-path "/path/to/javafx/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.graphics,javafx.media
```

The program can build properly but might throw exceptions if the modules are not added properly.
